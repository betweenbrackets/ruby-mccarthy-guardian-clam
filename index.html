    A favicon is the small picture that shows up in the browser's
    tab. Historically, these used a proprietary ".ico" format, and
    you needed to provide many different sizes.
    Happily, you can now provide a single vector graphic in SVG
    format. It will scale to any size, and still look crisp.

          A hollowed cottonwood by the sea, <br/>

          That did not speak when called upon <br/>
          That did not speak when called upon <br/>
          That did not speak when called upon <br/>
          <br/>
          And the sea went terribly wrong <br/>
          Shoved where swayed <br/>
          Wove where waved <br/>
          Quickened, slickened, thickened <br/>
          <br/>
          The Mastodon asked, <br/>
          "What have you learned through guarding me?" <br/>
          "To speak only when necessary"<br/>
          "And how might you reach the sea?"<br/>
          <br/>
          "But the sea's too big" <br/>
          "No bigger than a tear" <br/>
          "But the sea's too wide" <br/>
          "No wider than fear" <br/>
          "But the sea cannot hear" <br/>
          "Only when you do not speak" <br/>

          The Guardian Clam of the Mastodon Tree, <br/>
          A hollowed cottonwood by the sea, <br/>
          Opened bigger than a tear <br/>
          Opened wider than fear <br/>
          Singing <br/>
          And in flowed the sea <br/>
          By necessity washed clean <br/>
